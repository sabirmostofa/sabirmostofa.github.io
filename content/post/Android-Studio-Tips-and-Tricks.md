VS Code has a very useful feature that auto formats code after saving. Although Android Studio doesn't have it, same can be achieved by using Macros.

Now from the top menu:
> Edit > Macros > Start Macro recording 

Then use as many combinations you want. I wanted to remove unused imports and format code on save. 

> ctrl+alt+o   ctrl+alt+s    ctrl+s

Finally add a keyboard shortcut:

> File > Settings > Keymap  select macro and rightclick to add keyboard shortcut

I am using ***ctrl+shift+s***
